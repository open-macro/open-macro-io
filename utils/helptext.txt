Parameters
==========

The model is calibrated to an average low-income country. To customize the simulation, change the parameters to values that reflect country-specific economic conditions. For more help, see <a href="http://econ.duke.edu/~kdh9/Source%20Materials/Research/Facts%20and%20Artifacts.pdf" target="_blank">this instructive paper</a>.


Shocks
======

Shocks can reflect economic policy choices (like the level of government borrowing) or exogenous economic conditions (like the price of oil or other natural resources). For each shock, input your own forecasts as time series or as a constant value over a given range of time.


Analyze
=======

Take a look at the simulated economic variables that the model produces. Select which time series to display in the drop-down menu above each plot. Note that each period in this model is one year.


Console
=======

This console displays some statistics about the steady state and the dynamic paths of model variables; this output is generated by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/" target="_blank">GNU Octave</a> and <a href="http://www.dynare.org/" target="_blank">Dynare</a>. Any simulation errors can be examined here as well.


Debt type dropdown menu
=======================

Section header should be "Choose debt type"

Explainer text: "Select the debt type that will be used to close the fiscal gap (expenditures - reveues). Exogenous (concessional) must be specified on the Shocks page. Endogenous commercial or domestic will be determined by the model."

The median rate of return on World Bank projects circa 2001 was 20% in SSA and 15-29% for various sub-categories of infrastructure investment. Foster and Brice\u00f1o-Garmendia (2010) estimate returns for electricity water and sanitation irrigation and roads range from 17% to 24%. Similarly the macro-based estimates in Dalgaard and Hansen (2005) cluster between 15% and 30% for a wide array of different estimators. Hulten et al. (2006) Escribano et al. (2008) Calder\u00f3n et al. (2009) and Calder\u00f3n and Serv\u00e9n (2010) supply additional evidence of high returns. All of this adds up to a presumption that high returns are the norm. We consider a high-return scenario as the base case by setting the return on infrastructure to 0.25 at the initial steady state."

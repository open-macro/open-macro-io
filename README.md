When economists make accurate forecasts, the result is a healthier economy for everyone. But for economists at most central banks around the world, the necessary forecasting tools are difficult to use and too expensive. These obstacles put their countries—and the people in them—at an economic disadvantage. That’s why we created Open Macro.

We believe in letting economists do what they were trained to do: economics. Creating great economic forecasts used to mean doing heavy-duty computer programming on top of economic analysis, but we’ve made things simple. Instead of writing line upon line of code, with Open Macro the economist can run the same tests with just the click of a button.

Every country should have a fair shot at cultivating a healthy economy. But the computing power and modeling software used by economists at the forefront of the industry are simply not affordable for most countries in the world. With Open Macro, these cutting-edge tools are now accessible to central banks across the globe. That’s because Open Macro is powered by open-source software. No costly software licenses needed.
